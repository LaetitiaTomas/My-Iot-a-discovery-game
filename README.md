# My-Iot-a-discovery-game
This interactive game aims to raise awareness and initiate a change in mindsets and behaviors regarding the impacts of the globalized micro and nano technology industry in an accessible, creative and engaging way.   
This game therefore seeks to make information on the impacts of the IoT production chain accessible in order to encourage dialogue among different stakeholders: students, designers, and IoT users. Using  knowledge-sharing,  serious  games  and  circular  economy  tools,  the  group’s  collective  intelligence is engaged to reflect on the implementation behavioral changes for digital sobriety. This  game  is  modular  and  combines  different  phases  that  may  be  used  separately  or  in  combinations, depending on the facilitator’s objectives.
